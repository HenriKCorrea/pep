  abstractnote = {Digital Twins (DTs) systems are virtual representations of physical assets allowing organizations to gain insights and improve existing processes. In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.},

  abstractnote = {Digital twin (DT) is an emerging technology that enables sophisticated interaction between physical objects and their virtual replicas. Although DT has recently gained significant attraction in both industry and academia, there is no systematic understanding of DT from its development history to its different concepts and applications in disparate disciplines. The majority of DT literature focuses on the conceptual development of DT frameworks for a specific implementation area. Hence, this paper provides a state-of-the-art review of DT history, different definitions and models, and six types of key enabling technologies. The review also provides a comprehensive survey of DT applications from two perspectives: (1) applications in four product-lifecycle phases, i.e. product design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance, and recycling and (2) applications in four categorized engineering fields, including aerospace engineering, tunneling and underground engineering, wind engineering and Internet of things (IoT) applications. DT frameworks, characteristic components, key technologies and specific applications are extracted for each DT category in this paper. A comprehensive survey of the DT references reveals the following findings: (1) The majority of existing DT models only involve one-way data transfer from physical entities to virtual models and (2) There is a lack of consideration of the environmental coupling, which results in the inaccurate representation of the virtual components in existing DT models. Thus, this paper highlights the role of environmental factor in DT enabling technologies and in categorized engineering applications. In addition, the review discusses the key challenges and provides future work for constructing DTs of complex engineering systems.},

Although innovations provided by the advancement of digitalization have paved the way for more efficient operations and products for transportation, the rail transportation sector struggles to keep up with the rest of the transportation industry, since trains are designed to last for decades, and the insufficient infrastructure investment leads to multiple railroad derailments across the globe. Therefore, the primary aim is to transform current railway systems into human-centric, adaptable, sustainable and future-proof networks, aligning with Industry 5.0 (I5.0) and Circular Economy (CE) model supported by the restorative and long-lasting design of the trains. This transformation necessitates leveraging digitalization and emerging technologies to address the needs of passengers, operators, and maintenance personnel. This article provides a comprehensive review focusing on the application of IoT, AI, CE principles, and digital twin trains to existing railway infrastructure and assets. The analysis delves into developing system architecture for proposed solutions and their impact on operation, maintenance, sustainability, and passenger comfort, supported by track record analysis. The integration of these technologies and concepts, particularly AI-powered services, is anticipated to yield immediate advancements in the digitalization of railway transportation, enhancing efficiency and safety measures.},

  abstractnote = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with Digital Twins (DTs) has emerged as a promising approach to revolutionize healthcare, particularly in terms of diagnosis and management of thoracic disorders. This study proposes a comprehensive framework, named Lung-DT, which leverages IoT sensors and AI algorithms to establish the digital representation of a patient’s respiratory health. Using the YOLOv8 neural network, the Lung-DT system accurately classifies chest X-rays into five distinct categories of lung diseases, including “normal”, “covid”, “lung_opacity”, “pneumonia”, and “tuberculosis”. The performance of the system was evaluated employing a chest X-ray dataset available in the literature, demonstrating average accuracy of 96.8%, precision of 92%, recall of 97%, and F1-score of 94%. The proposed Lung-DT framework offers several advantages over conventional diagnostic methods. Firstly, it enables real-time monitoring of lung health through continuous data acquisition from IoT sensors, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Secondly, the AI-powered classification module provides automated and objective assessments of chest X-rays, reducing dependence on subjective human interpretation. Thirdly, the twin digital representation of the patient’s respiratory health allows for comprehensive analysis and correlation of multiple data streams, providing valuable insights as to personalized treatment plans. The integration of IoT sensors, AI algorithms, and DT technology within the Lung-DT system demonstrates a significant step towards improving thoracic healthcare. By enabling continuous monitoring, automated diagnosis, and comprehensive data analysis, the Lung-DT framework has enormous potential to enhance patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource allocation.},

  abstractnote = {Digital twins (DTs) are often defined as a pairing of a physical entity and a corresponding virtual entity (VE), mimicking certain aspects of the former depending on the use-case. In recent years, this concept has facilitated numerous use-cases ranging from design to validation and predictive maintenance of large and small high-tech systems. Various heterogeneous cross-domain models are essential for such systems, and model-driven engineering plays a pivotal role in the design, development, and maintenance of these models. We believe models and model-driven engineering play a similarly crucial role in the context of a VE of a DT. Due to the rapidly growing popularity of DTs and their use in diverse domains and use-cases, the methodologies, tools, and practices for designing, developing, and maintaining the corresponding VEs differ vastly. To better understand these differences and similarities, we performed a semi-structured interview research with 19 professionals from industry and academia who are closely associated with different lifecycle stages of digital twins. In this paper, we present our analysis and findings from this study, which is based on seven research questions. In general, we identified an overall lack of uniformity in terms of the understanding of digital twins and used tools, techniques, and methodologies for the development and maintenance of the corresponding VEs. Furthermore, considering that digital twins are software intensive systems, we recognize a significant growth potential for adopting more software engineering practices, processes, and expertise in various stages of a digital twin’s lifecycle.},
