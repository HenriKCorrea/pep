\chapter{Planned Activities and Timeline}
\label{chap:plan}

This research follows an iterative agent-first development process, prioritizing early
    validation of the core agent protocol capabilities before full system integration.

\section{Development Phases}
\label{sec:development-phases}

\textbf{Sprint 1: Agent Protocol Spike}

Focus: Validate MCP and A2A protocols work for semantic negotiation with minimal infrastructure.

\textit{Activities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement mock SmartCity Agent and EnergyGrid Agent with hardcoded schemas
    \item Create simplified scenario: 3 charging stations, 2 transformers
    \item Develop MCP server exposing mock entity schemas
    \item Implement A2A negotiation for basic semantic mappings
    \item Test agent discovery and mapping establishment
\end{itemize}

\textit{Deliverable:} Working agent communication demonstrating schema discovery and semantic mapping negotiation without full DT platforms.

\textit{Risk Mitigation:} Validating agent protocols early prevents wasted effort on DT infrastructure if protocols prove insufficient.

\textbf{Sprint 2: Single DT Platform Integration}

Focus: Integrate agents with real KTWIN deployment to validate platform introspection.

\textit{Activities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deploy KTWIN cluster with \texttt{opendigitaltwins-smartcities} DTDL
    \item Create 3-5 \texttt{ChargingStation} digital twins with realistic properties
    \item Extend SmartCity Agent to introspect KTWIN's DTDL schemas via MCP
    \item Implement agent queries against live KTWIN twins
    \item Simulate EV charging requests with mock grid constraints
\end{itemize}

\textit{Deliverable:} SmartCity Agent dynamically querying KTWIN and recommending charging stations based on real twin data.

\textbf{Sprint 3: Heterogeneous Platform Integration}

Focus: Add Ditto platform and demonstrate cross-platform semantic bridging.

\textit{Activities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deploy Eclipse Ditto cluster
    \item Translate \texttt{opendigitaltwins-energygrid} CIM-based DTDL to Ditto Thing model
    \item Create 2-3 \texttt{Transformer} twins with linked \texttt{UsagePoints}
    \item Implement EnergyGrid Agent with Ditto Thing API integration
    \item Develop spatial reasoning module mapping charging station locations to usage points
    \item Implement A2A semantic negotiation between SmartCity and EnergyGrid agents
\end{itemize}

\textit{Deliverable:} Agents successfully negotiate \texttt{ChargingStation} $\leftrightarrow$ \texttt{UsagePoint} mapping and answer cross-domain query:
    ``Which charging stations connect to Transformer T1?''

\textbf{Sprint 4: Complete Use Case and Orchestration}

Focus: Full scenario implementation with orchestration layer and evaluation.

\textit{Activities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement centralized orchestration agent
    \item Develop EV charging scheduler using agent-mediated coordination
    \item Create simulation framework with 50 EV agents and realistic load profiles
    \item Implement monitoring and metrics collection
    \item Execute scenario runs with varying EV arrival patterns and grid conditions
    \item Compare against baseline approaches (manual integration, shared ontology)
\end{itemize}

\textit{Deliverable:} Complete proof-of-concept demonstrating cross-domain optimization with quantitative evaluation results.
