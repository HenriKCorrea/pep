  abstractnote = {Digital Twins (DTs) systems are virtual representations of
                  physical assets allowing organizations to gain insights and
                  improve existing processes. In practice, DTs require proper
                  modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment
                  along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established
                  patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we
                  propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for
                  Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the
                  state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing
                  DT operators to easily define models through open standards
                  and configure details of the underlying services and
                  infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the
                  developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher
                  level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use
                  case without compromising the solution scalability. The
                  tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60%
                  and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.},

                  sophisticated interaction between physical objects and
                  their virtual replicas. Although DT has recently gained
                  significant attraction in both industry and academia, there
                  is no systematic understanding of DT from its development
                  history to its different concepts and applications in
                  disparate disciplines. The majority of DT literature
                  focuses on the conceptual development of DT frameworks for
                  a specific implementation area. Hence, this paper provides
                  a state-of-the-art review of DT history, different
                  definitions and models, and six types of key enabling
                  technologies. The review also provides a comprehensive
                  survey of DT applications from two perspectives: (1)
                  applications in four product-lifecycle phases, i.e. product
                  design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance, and
                  recycling and (2) applications in four categorized
                  engineering fields, including aerospace engineering,
                  tunneling and underground engineering, wind engineering and
                  Internet of things (IoT) applications. DT frameworks,
                  characteristic components, key technologies and specific
                  applications are extracted for each DT category in this
                  paper. A comprehensive survey of the DT references reveals
                  the following findings: (1) The majority of existing DT
                  models only involve one-way data transfer from physical
                  entities to virtual models and (2) There is a lack of
                  consideration of the environmental coupling, which results
                  in the inaccurate representation of the virtual components
                  in existing DT models. Thus, this paper highlights the role
                  of environmental factor in DT enabling technologies and in
                  categorized engineering applications. In addition, the
                  review discusses the key challenges and provides future
                  work for constructing DTs of complex engineering systems.},

                  of digitalization have paved the way for more efficient
                  operations and products for transportation, the rail
                  transportation sector struggles to keep up with the rest of
                  the transportation industry, since trains are designed to
                  last for decades, and the insufficient infrastructure
                  investment leads to multiple railroad derailments across
                  the globe. Therefore, the primary aim is to transform
                  current railway systems into human-centric, adaptable,
                  sustainable and future-proof networks, aligning with

                  Digital Twins (DTs) has emerged as a promising approach to
                  revolutionize healthcare, particularly in terms of
                  diagnosis and management of thoracic disorders. This study
                  proposes a comprehensive framework, named Lung-DT, which
                  leverages IoT sensors and AI algorithms to establish the
                  digital representation of a patient’s respiratory health.
                  Using the YOLOv8 neural network, the Lung-DT system
                  accurately classifies chest X-rays into five distinct
                  categories of lung diseases, including “normal”,
                  “covid”, “lung_opacity”, “pneumonia”, and
                  “tuberculosis”. The performance of the system was
                  evaluated employing a chest X-ray dataset available in the
                  literature, demonstrating average accuracy of 96.8%,
                  precision of 92%, recall of 97%, and F1-score of 94%. The
                  proposed Lung-DT framework offers several advantages over
                  conventional diagnostic methods. Firstly, it enables
                  real-time monitoring of lung health through continuous data
                  acquisition from IoT sensors, facilitating early diagnosis
                  and intervention. Secondly, the AI-powered classification
                  module provides automated and objective assessments of
                  chest X-rays, reducing dependence on subjective human
                  interpretation. Thirdly, the twin digital representation of
                  the patient’s respiratory health allows for comprehensive
                  analysis and correlation of multiple data streams,
                  providing valuable insights as to personalized treatment
                  plans. The integration of IoT sensors, AI algorithms, and
                  DT technology within the Lung-DT system demonstrates a
                  significant step towards improving thoracic healthcare. By
                  enabling continuous monitoring, automated diagnosis, and
                  comprehensive data analysis, the Lung-DT framework has
                  enormous potential to enhance patient outcomes, reduce
                  healthcare costs, and optimize resource allocation.},
