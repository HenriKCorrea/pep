\section{Context and Motivation}

Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a transformative technology, enabling organizations to create virtual replicas of physical systems, processes, and environments. These virtual counterparts facilitate real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of their physical counterparts, driving innovation across industries from manufacturing and healthcare to smart cities and infrastructure management \cite{digital_twin_survey}. However, despite their tremendous potential, the development and deployment of Digital Twin solutions remain complex, resource-intensive endeavors that require significant expertise across multiple technological domains.

The complexity of Digital Twin development stems from several interconnected challenges. First, the heterogeneous nature of the technology stack involves integrating diverse tools, frameworks, and platforms, each with its own data formats, APIs, and operational paradigms \cite{enabling_technologies}. Second, the development process requires expertise spanning multiple domains: domain-specific knowledge for modeling real-world systems, software engineering skills for implementation, and operational expertise for deployment and maintenance. Third, the high costs associated with Digital Twin development—estimated to potentially reach trillions of dollars for large-scale implementations \cite{cost_estimation}—create significant barriers to entry, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-assisted software development tools, present unprecedented opportunities to address these challenges. The democratization of AI through platforms like GitHub Copilot has already transformed traditional software development by automating routine tasks, bridging knowledge gaps, and accelerating development cycles. However, the application of AI to Digital Twin development processes remains largely unexplored, with existing research focusing primarily on AI as a component within operational Digital Twin solutions rather than as a development enabler.

\section{Problem Statement}

This research addresses a critical gap in the Digital Twin development ecosystem: the lack of AI-powered tools and methodologies specifically designed to improve productivity, reduce complexity, and democratize access to Digital Twin development. Current approaches to Digital Twin development suffer from several limitations that AI assistance could potentially address:

\textbf{Persona Overload and Skill Distribution}: Analysis of existing Digital Twin platforms, such as KTWIN—a serverless Kubernetes-based Digital Twin platform \cite{ktwin}—reveals imbalanced responsibility distribution across development personas. Domain experts become overloaded with both strategic modeling tasks and operational configuration duties, while the potential for role consolidation through AI assistance remains unexplored.

\textbf{Tool Integration Complexity}: The heterogeneous nature of Digital Twin toolchains creates significant integration overhead, requiring developers to master multiple technologies and manage complex interoperability challenges. This complexity is exacerbated when developers must work with unfamiliar technologies, leading to suboptimal architectural decisions based on existing expertise rather than optimal solutions \cite{interview_study}.

\textbf{Limited Development-Phase AI Application}: While AI is increasingly integrated into operational Digital Twin solutions for analytics and optimization, its application to the development lifecycle—including modeling, implementation, integration, and deployment—remains minimal and fragmented.
