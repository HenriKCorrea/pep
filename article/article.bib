  abstractnote = {Digital Twins (DTs) systems are virtual representations of physical assets allowing organizations to gain insights and improve existing processes. In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.},

  abstractnote = {Digital twin (DT) is an emerging technology that enables sophisticated interaction between physical objects and their virtual replicas. Although DT has recently gained significant attraction in both industry and academia, there is no systematic understanding of DT from its development history to its different concepts and applications in disparate disciplines. The majority of DT literature focuses on the conceptual development of DT frameworks for a specific implementation area. Hence, this paper provides a state-of-the-art review of DT history, different definitions and models, and six types of key enabling technologies. The review also provides a comprehensive survey of DT applications from two perspectives: (1) applications in four product-lifecycle phases, i.e. product design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance, and recycling and (2) applications in four categorized engineering fields, including aerospace engineering, tunneling and underground engineering, wind engineering and Internet of things (IoT) applications. DT frameworks, characteristic components, key technologies and specific applications are extracted for each DT category in this paper. A comprehensive survey of the DT references reveals the following findings: (1) The majority of existing DT models only involve one-way data transfer from physical entities to virtual models and (2) There is a lack of consideration of the environmental coupling, which results in the inaccurate representation of the virtual components in existing DT models. Thus, this paper highlights the role of environmental factor in DT enabling technologies and in categorized engineering applications. In addition, the review discusses the key challenges and provides future work for constructing DTs of complex engineering systems.},

Although innovations provided by the advancement of digitalization have paved the way for more efficient operations and products for transportation, the rail transportation sector struggles to keep up with the rest of the transportation industry, since trains are designed to last for decades, and the insufficient infrastructure investment leads to multiple railroad derailments across the globe. Therefore, the primary aim is to transform current railway systems into human-centric, adaptable, sustainable and future-proof networks, aligning with Industry 5.0 (I5.0) and Circular Economy (CE) model supported by the restorative and long-lasting design of the trains. This transformation necessitates leveraging digitalization and emerging technologies to address the needs of passengers, operators, and maintenance personnel. This article provides a comprehensive review focusing on the application of IoT, AI, CE principles, and digital twin trains to existing railway infrastructure and assets. The analysis delves into developing system architecture for proposed solutions and their impact on operation, maintenance, sustainability, and passenger comfort, supported by track record analysis.

This study proposes a comprehensive framework, named Lung-DT, which leverages IoT sensors and AI algorithms to establish the digital representation of a patient’s respiratory health. Using the YOLOv8 neural network, the Lung-DT system accurately classifies chest X-rays into five distinct categories of lung diseases, including “normal”, “covid”, “lung_opacity”, “pneumonia”, and “tuberculosis”. The performance of the system was evaluated employing a chest X-ray dataset available in the literature, demonstrating average accuracy of 96.8%, precision of 92%, recall of 97%, and F1-score of 94%. The proposed Lung-DT framework offers several advantages over conventional diagnostic methods. Firstly, it enables real-time monitoring of lung health through continuous data acquisition from IoT sensors, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Secondly, the AI-powered classification module provides automated and objective assessments of chest X-rays, reducing dependence on subjective human interpretation. Thirdly, the twin digital representation of the patient’s respiratory health allows for comprehensive analysis and correlation of multiple data streams, providing valuable insights as to personalized treatment plans. The integration of IoT sensors, AI algorithms, and DT technology within the Lung-DT system demonstrates a significant step towards improving thoracic healthcare. By enabling continuous monitoring, automated diagnosis, and comprehensive data analysis, the Lung-DT framework has enormous potential to enhance patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource allocation.},

In recent years, this concept has facilitated numerous use-cases ranging from design to validation and predictive maintenance of large and small high-tech systems. Various heterogeneous cross-domain models are essential for such systems, and model-driven engineering plays a pivotal role in the design, development, and maintenance of these models. We believe models and model-driven engineering play a similarly crucial role in the context of a VE of a DT. Due to the rapidly growing popularity of DTs and their use in diverse domains and use-cases, the methodologies, tools, and practices for designing, developing, and maintaining the corresponding VEs differ vastly. To better understand these differences and similarities, we performed a semi-structured interview research with 19 professionals from industry and academia who are closely associated with different lifecycle stages of digital twins. In this paper, we present our analysis and findings from this study, which is based on seven research questions. In general, we identified an overall lack of uniformity in terms of the understanding of digital twins and used tools, techniques, and methodologies for the development and maintenance of the corresponding VEs. Furthermore, considering that digital twins are software intensive systems, we recognize a significant growth potential for adopting more software engineering practices, processes, and expertise in various stages of a digital twin’s lifecycle.},

Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”. The conclusions present a set of conditions, best practices, and base capabilities for building a knowledge framework, which makes use of the Digital Twin paradigm and the DE approach to support decision makers with the SDG agenda implementation.},

Despite the increasing demand for sophisticated digital twinning solutions across all domains and scopes, their development is often still constrained by differing definitions, different understandings of their functional scope and design, and a lack of concrete methodology toward implementing a comprehensive digital twinning solution. Although there are already papers that evaluate the capabilities of existing digital twinning solutions on the basis of maturity levels, these usually consider the object to be twinned in isolation and are often domain-specific. With this article we address exactly this gap discussing how interoperability of digital twins can break physical boundaries of an isolated system, enabling system of systems joint optimization. We therefore consider interoperable digital twins to be the most mature twinning platforms, thus, we discuss in detail six digital twin maturity levels, departing from the interrelated contexts of ports, cities, and supply chains. Examples drawn from these domains demonstrate the need for interoperability toward optimizing processes and systems in realistic contexts, rather than in assumed isolation.},

Interoperability of devices and systems can be seen as the key enabler of smart grids. Therefore, international initiatives have been started in order to identify interoperability core standards for Smart Grids.  IEC 62357, the so called Seamless Integration Architecture, is one of these very core standards, which has been identified by recent Smart Grid initiatives and roadmaps to be essential for building and managing intelligent power systems. The Seamless Integration Architecture provides an overview of the interoperability and relations between further standards from IEC TC 57 like the IEC 61970/61968: Common Information Model - CIM. CIM has proven to be a mature standard for interoperability and engineering; consequently, it is a cornerstone of the IEC Smart Grid Standardization Roadmap. This book provides an overview on how the CIM developed,in which international projects and roadmaps is has already been covered and describes the basic use cases for CIM. This book has been written for both Power Engineers trying to get to know the EMS and business IT part of Smart Grid and for Computer Scientist finding out where ICT technology is applied in EMS and DMS Systems. The book is divided into two parts dealing with the theoretical foundations and a practical part describing tools and use cases for CIM.},

We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

Results show improved responsiveness, autonomy, and sustainability in process operations.

This paper introduces SMIA (Self-configurable Manufacturing Industrial Agents), a dual-layer solution that operationalizes these standards by converging semantic modeling and distributed software execution. First, SMIA proposes a methodology for characterizing proactive AAS by enriching their descriptions with an OWL ontology based on the CSS model. Second, it provides a software toolchain that automatically generates Digital Twins --implemented as FIPA-compliant industrial agents using SPADE -- from these enriched AAS descriptions. The resulting agents can react to external events, coordinating with peers and executing domain-specific skills within a standardized I4.0 communication framework. Built following an Open Source Software Engineering approach, SMIA leverages mature tools such as Eclipse BaSyx, OWLReady2 and SPADE, showcasing a replicable and extensible approach to the adoption of industrial standards in practice. A preliminary validation in a robotic logistics scenario demonstrates its feasibility and adaptability.},

Yet, many implementations remain monolithic, limiting interoperability and reusability. This paper introduces a semantic and modular architecture for orchestrating AI-driven DTs, designed to enable scalable integration and standardized coordination across industrial systems. The system employs a semantic API aligned with NGSI-LD, to expose industrial entities such as processes, anomalies, assets, and contextual KPIs (e.g., energy usage, CO2 emissions, tool wear, product quality). AI techniques ranging from threshold adjustment to symbolic learning are encapsulated as modular agents, each performing targeted optimization tasks. These agents operate over the semantic API, which ensures consistent, interpretable interactions across modules. A Manager and a Recommender agent are defined to coordinate execution; while not yet deployed at runtime, their logic is implemented through semantic interfaces that support traceable, modular activation. The system is validated using synthetic data simulating machining, assembly, and inspection tasks. Results show measurable improvements in sustainability-related KPIs following each module's activation. More importantly, the semantic orchestration layer enables modularity, interoperability, and AI reuse. This work contributes a standards-compliant foundation for next-generation DTs, supporting integration with ecosystems such as FIWARE, Catena-X, and IDS, and aligned with the principles of Industry 4.0 and 5.0.},

A novel upper-level Sliding Work Sharing ontology is defined to support semantic interoperability and reasoning across diverse domains, facilitating sliding work sharing in complex environments. The ontology is grounded in Industry 5.0 concepts and built upon the Industrial Ontology Foundry core ontology. It extends conventional scheduling ontologies by incorporating key constructs for Digital Twins, Human Digital Twins, and dynamic task flows. We validate the ontology through two use cases from the domains of automation in construction and manufacturing. The collaborative construction case involves robots and humans, while the manufacturing one integrates legacy systems, artificial intelligence actors, and human planners. The developed ontology system is evaluated for its coverage and expressiveness through a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation based methodology, applied on diverse Large Language Models to derive competency questions from external sources. This approach enhances conventional ontology validation techniques with a scalable and unbiased alternative. Logical consistency is confirmed using a range of standard reasoners. Our results demonstrate that the Sliding Work Sharing ontology has considerable flexibility and potential to advance human--AI teaming in future work environments.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract = {The early successes of computer networks in the mid-1970's made it apparent that to utilize the full potential of computer networks, international standards would be required. In 1977, the International Standards Organization (ISO) initiated work on Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) to address these requirements. This paper briefly describes the OSI Reference Model. The OSI Reference Model is the highest level of abstraction in the OSI scheme. The paper first describes the basic building blocks used to construct the network model. Then the particular seven-layer model used by OSI is briefly described, followed by a discussion of outstanding issues and future extensions for the model.},

  abstract = {We present AutoGen, an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications by composing multiple agents to converse with each other to accomplish tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. It also enables developers to create flexible agent behaviors and conversation patterns for different applications using both natural language and code. AutoGen serves as a generic infrastructure and is widely used by AI practitioners and researchers to build diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness with several pilot applications, with domains ranging from mathematics and coding to question-answering, supply-chain optimization, online decision-making, and entertainment.},
